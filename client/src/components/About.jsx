        <p className='text-justify'>I'm a passionate Web Developer who loves turning ideas into interactive digital experiences. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy building web applications that are not just functional, but also user-friendly and visually engaging. I'm always curious, always learning, and constantly striving to improve my craft. Whether it's solving complex problems or exploring new frameworks, I thrive on the creative side of code. When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me exploring design trends, learning new tech, or binging sci-fi shows.</p>
